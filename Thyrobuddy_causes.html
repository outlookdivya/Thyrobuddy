    <div class="main_content-body-text">
      <p>Problems with the thyroid can be caused by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          iodine deficiency</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system attacks the thyroid,
          leading either to hyperthyroidism (caused by Gravesâ€™ disease) or
          hypothyroidism (caused by Hashimoto's disease)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>inflammation (which may or may not cause pain), caused by a virus or
          bacteria</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>nodules, or non-cancerous lumps</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>cancerous tumors</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>certain medical treatments, including radiation therapy, thyroid
          surgery, and some medicines</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>some genetic disorders</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Occasionally, pregnancy can cause thyroid problems to start or get
        worse. If left untreated, this can cause problems for mother and baby,
        including miscarriage, premature birth, preeclampsia and bleeding after
        the birth.</p>
