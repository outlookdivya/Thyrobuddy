    <div style="text-align: center;">The thyroid gland is a small organ that’s
      located in the front of the neck, wrapped around the windpipe (trachea).
      It’s shaped like a butterfly, smaller in the middle with two wide wings
      that extend around the side of your throat. The thyroid is a gland. You
      have glands throughout your body, where they create and release substances
      that help your body do a specific thing. Your thyroid makes hormones that
      help control many vital functions of your body.</div>

    <h4>Functioning of thyroid gland:</h4>
    <p>Your thyroid has an important job to do within your body — releasing and
      controlling thyroid hormones that control metabolism. Metabolism is a
      process where the food you take into your body is transformed into energy.
      This energy is used throughout your entire body to keep many of your
      body’s systems working correctly. Think of your metabolism as a generator.
      It takes in raw energy and uses it to power something bigger.</p>
    <p>The thyroid controls your metabolism with a few specific hormones — T4
      (thyroxine, contains four iodide atoms) and T3 (triiodothyronine, contains
      three iodide atoms). These two hormones are created by the thyroid and
      they tell the body’s cells how much energy to use. When your thyroid works
      properly, it will maintain the right amount of hormones to keep your
      metabolism working at the right rate. As the hormones are used, the
      thyroid creates replacements.</p>
    <p>This is all supervised by something called the pituitary gland. Located
      in the center of the skull, below your brain, the pituitary gland monitors
      and controls the amount of thyroid hormones in your bloodstream. When the
      pituitary gland senses a lack of thyroid hormones or a high level of
      hormones in your body, it will adjust the amounts with its own hormone.
      This hormone is called thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The TSH will be
      sent to the thyroid and it will tell the thyroid what needs to be done to
      get the body back to normal.</p>
